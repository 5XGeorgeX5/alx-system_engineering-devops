## Issue Summary
- **Duration:** November 5, 2023, 10:30 AM - November 5, 2023, 1:15 PM (UTC)
- **Impact:** The outage affected our primary web application, resulting in degraded performance and unavailability for approximately 30% of our users.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the outage was a misconfigured firewall rule that blocked critical incoming traffic to our application servers.

## Timeline
- **10:30 AM (UTC):** The issue was detected when the monitoring system triggered an alert for increased error rates and latency.
- **10:35 AM:** The incident was escalated to the on-call DevOps team.
- **10:40 AM:** Initial investigations led us to suspect database performance issues, which turned out to be a misleading path.
- **11:15 AM:** With no improvement in service, we suspected a DDoS attack and engaged our security team.
- **11:45 AM:** Further investigations revealed the firewall rule misconfiguration.
- **12:00 PM:** The incident was escalated to our network team for immediate resolution.
- **1:15 PM:** The issue was resolved, and service was fully restored.

## Root Cause and Resolution
- **Root Cause:** The firewall rule, designed to prevent certain traffic, was inadvertently updated and misconfigured to block all incoming traffic, including legitimate requests to the application servers.
- **Resolution:** The network team corrected the misconfigured firewall rule and verified that legitimate traffic could flow seamlessly to the application servers.

## Corrective and Preventative Measures
To prevent such incidents in the future, we will take the following corrective and preventative measures:
1. Regular Firewall Rule Audits: Conduct periodic reviews of firewall rules to identify and correct misconfigurations.
2. Improved Monitoring: Enhance monitoring to provide more granular insights into network traffic patterns, ensuring early detection of anomalies.
3. Documentation: Strengthen documentation and change management processes for firewall rule updates.
4. Training: Provide additional training to team members involved in firewall rule management.
5. Automated Testing: Implement automated testing of firewall rule changes in a staging environment before applying them to the production network.

## Summary
The service outage on November 5, 2023, lasting from 10:30 AM to 1:15 PM (UTC), impacted our primary web application, affecting around 30% of our users. The root cause was a misconfigured firewall rule, which was resolved by our network team. To prevent future occurrences, we will conduct regular firewall rule audits, improve monitoring, enhance documentation and change management processes, provide training, and implement automated testing of firewall rule changes. Our commitment to these measures will ensure the resilience and reliability of our services.
